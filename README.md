## Jasper Bears Map
Map of Bear Incidents by type (Black and Grizzly) in Jasper National Park of Canada. Open index.html via Google Chrome after downloading the Jasper Bears folder. Give the map a bit of time to load, it is a bit slow at first. Click on the points for more information about the bear incident, and deselect elements in the legend to remove incident type from map. Zoom in and out to reveal more points.
